=== Terminal Wather on Python ===

This project is using OpenWeatherMap API to get information about current weather in a place which you mentioned.

Don't forget to check the beggining of the code, because you have to paste you own API key.

This code can be very useful if you prefer to use your OS without window manager and GUI.
